Hi all,
This page provides a simple tool to convert spline entities into polylines in DXF files.
âœ… Minimum supported version: AutoCAD 2004 / LT 2004 (.dxf)
ðŸ”§ Tolerance range: 0.001 â€“ 10 (recommended: 0.01)
By converting splines to polylines, your DXF calculation process becomes smoother and more efficientâ€”especially for downstream workflows like CAM, simulation, or data extraction.

Need help or want to integrate this into your workflow? Feel free to reach out.
